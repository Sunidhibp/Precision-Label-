Project Overview:
Precision Label is a web application developed for audio annotation. This tool allows users to label audio data with metadata to identify specific features within the audio signal, such as marking time stamps, transcribing spoken words, identifying different speakers, labeling environmental sounds, and more. The application is essential for training machine learning models in tasks like speech recognition, speaker identification, and sound classification.

Features:
Audio Transcription: Convert spoken language in audio files into written text.
Speaker Diarization: Identify and label different speakers within an audio file.
Event/Sound Labeling: Tag specific sounds or events within an audio file.
Phonetic Annotation: Mark phonetic details within an audio file.
Emotion Annotation: Label the emotional tone conveyed in the audio.

Technologies Used:
HTML
CSS (Bootstrap 4)
JavaScript
